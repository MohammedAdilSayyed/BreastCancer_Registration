## 📊 Data

The project uses breast cancer imaging data with the following characteristics:
- **Image Format**: PNG files with metadata
- **Data Structure**: Organized by patient ID, coordinates, and classification
- **Metadata**: JSON files containing image annotations and labels

## 🔬 Usage

### Data Exploration

Start with the Jupyter notebook to explore your data:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
```

### Training

1. **Prepare your data** in the `data/` directory
2. **Run training** using the provided scripts
3. **Monitor progress** with TensorBoard:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir results/tensorboard
   ```

### Evaluation

The trained models are automatically saved in the `results/` directory:
- `best_model.pth`: Best performing model
- `checkpoint_*.pth`: Training checkpoints
- Evaluation metrics and visualizations
